# hello-world
Newbie - First repository

Everyone starts somewhere I suppose. This is where I'm starting. I'm exploring Mycroft-AI.
I have only rudimentary skills in code and I've never used Python.

Since no journey begins without a goal in mind, here is my goal: To develop my first Skill for Mycroft-AI.
That Skill will be the ability to ask the AI for a current status reading from the photovoltaic solar array on my home.

I have an advantage in that an API already exists to obtain this data from the array, so my specific goal is to have the AI obtain that data and recite it back to me upon request.

My Linux workstation is ready, the Mycroft-core is installed, and a Python development platform is up and running. Clearly, my new GitHub account is open and this is my first time using it.

If you are reading this ...wish me luck.
