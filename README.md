# About Me
Newbie - First repository

Everyone starts somewhere I suppose. This is where I'm starting. My interests started with exploring Mycroft-AI; we all know where that went.
Now I've gained an interest in Home Assistant, and especially voice assistants now that the ESP32 series of chips and firmware make this even more accessible.
I have only rudimentary skills in code and casual experience with Python.

I have HAOS running on a solid NUC. I've gravitated toward Matter-enabled devices and had excellent success. I have 35 different items now reporting into HAOS.
Through machine learning I've successfully compiled 2 highly effective custom wake words that operate very effectively using streaming wake word to a ESP32S3-BOX-3.
Now I've picked up a Home Assistant Voice PE, knowing full well it doesn't support a streaming wake word - and that's my first goal.
